Have tried out perplexity api ($5 limit right now, one prompt ~$0.006), might not be cost efficient if we want to specify the output format etc as that counts towards the api costs but could be worth it given the websearch if configured properly
I am now trying out OpenRouter api for free grok chatbot, seems useful
